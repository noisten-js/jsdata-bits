# jsdata-bits
Collection of templates and snippets (Red-Gate SQLPrompt flavor). The intent of this project is to make js.sql.snippets generally available. As other templates and snippets come about they'll probably be here too. For instance the js.py.snippets for PyCharm will likely be added here too.
